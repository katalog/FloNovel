 * (a follow-up to §Open Question 6 — contrary to the assumption that this was "a niche revisit case,"
 * "continue reading" turned out to be the most common entry path instead). This is a fallback that
 * reverse-derives relativePath by exploiting the fact that an SAF document URI's documentId string is
 * usually hierarchical, in the form "primary:folder/subfolder/file.txt" — stripping the saved tree root's
 * documentId off as a prefix. It's a heuristic that relies on the document provider using hierarchical IDs
 * (generally true for local storage providers), so it's not a 100% guarantee, but a failure just returns
 * null and doesn't affect existing behavior.
