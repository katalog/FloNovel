/**
 * `TtsController` is a thin wrapper around the real `android.speech.tts.TextToSpeech` engine. The
 * actual speech-synthesis completion timing varies by device/installed voice data, and TESTING.md
 * already marks it out of scope for automation (the callback never fires on devices with no engine
 * or no Korean voice data installed) — so this file doesn't assert on that real completion timing
 * either. Instead it verifies (1) that the ready-state exposure before/after engine init is correct,
 * (2) that calling methods before the engine is ready doesn't crash, and (3) that once the engine
 * actually becomes ready (if this device has TTS), speak() really does reach the completion callback
 * — skipping only (3), via Assume, on environments with no engine at all.
